              Welcome to Tinnara?, the only restaurant that checks on you like your amma does!
                Whether you're starving or just bored and hungry (we donâ€™t judge), weâ€™ve got your back and your plate!

                <br />
                <br />

                From spicy sambar that slaps harder than your cousin's Wi-Fi passwordâ€¦
                To crispy dosas thinner than your patience in traffic ðŸš—ðŸ’¨
                Our food is made with love, laughs, and just the right amount of karam! ðŸŒ¶ âœ¨ 

                <br />
                <br />

                Pull up a chair, unbutton that top jeans button (we wonâ€™t tell),
                and letâ€™s turn your hunger into happy tears.

                Because here, itâ€™s never just foodâ€¦ it's full-on <span style={{ color: "#5cb85c"}}>Vindu Bhojanam!</span>
